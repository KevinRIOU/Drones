                <h2>Military Drones</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>There is a lot of military drones as you can see below, we detail here all types of drones
                Drones are use to spying or to detect danger, with a camera, the pilot behind his computer do not risk his life and can collect a lot of informations, with specified drones pilots can make attack to protect people or many person.</p>
                <hr>
                
                <h3>RQ-2A Pionner (USA)</h3>
                <p>In the 1980s, U.S.A military operations in Libya, for example, identified a need for an inexpensive, unmanned, reconnaissance, and able to deal damage. As a result, in July 1985, the Navy make the acquisition of UAV systems for fleet operations using non-developmental technology. Two Pioneer systems were procured in December 1985 for testing during 1986. Initial system delivery was made in July 1986 and subsequently deployed on the battleship in December 1986.</p>
                <p>During 1987, three additional systems were delivered to the Marine Corps where they were operationally deployed on board LHA-class vessels as well as with several land-based units. Pioneer has operated in many theaters including the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Yugoslavia and Somalia. Marine Corps Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadrons deployed to Iraq in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and currently support Marine operations in Iraq. The Pioneer is launched using rocket-assisted takeoff or pneumatic rails and is recovered at sea. The Pioneer carries a payload of 65-100 pounds including an electro-optical and infrared camera and can patrol for more than five hours. Control of the RQ-2B can be handed off from control station to control station, thereby increasing the vehicleâ€™s range and allowing launch from one site and recovery at another. With a portable receiving station, Pioneer provides portable, payload imagery to forward deployed Marines. Pioneer has flown other payloads including an acoustic-wave vapor sensor and a hyperspectral imagery sensor.</p>

                <h3>QF-4 Aerial Target</h3>
                <p>The QF-4 is equipped to carry electronic and infrared countermeasures to fully evaluate fighters and weapons flown and fired against it. Full-scale aircraft can be flown totally by computer, or controlled manually during takeoff and landing using a mobile control station located at the runway. As a safety precaution, a chase plane trails the QF-4 during critical periods of flight.</p>
                <p>First flown in May 1958, the Phantom II originally was developed for U.S. Navy fleet defense and entered service in 1961. The Air Force evaluated it as the F-110A Spectre for close air support, interdiction and counter-air operations. In 1962, U.S. Air Force version was approved. The Air Force's Phantom II was designated F-4C, and first flew May 27, 1963. Production deliveries began in November 1963</p>

                <h3>R/MQ-8 Fire Scout</h3>
                <p>With vehicle endurance greater than five hours, a VTUAV system will be capable of twelve continuous hours of operations providing coverage 110 nautical miles from the launch site. The air vehicle is capable of providing UHF/VHF voice communications relay and has a baseline payload that includes electro-optical/infrared sensors and a laser designator that enables the system to find tactical targets, track and designate targets, accurately provide targeting data to strike platforms and perform battle damage assessment.</p>
