                <hr>

                <p>FPV (First Person View) racing is an exciting new sport that combines high-tech drones and high-speed racing.</p>

                <p>This is the world of first-person drone racing, an activity that currently occupies the ill-defined ground between dedicated pastime and fledgling sport. As drones become an increasingly mainstream phenomenon, racing leagues have popped up around the world. Anyone who takes it seriously, pilot or spectator, doesn't watch their craft from a distance, but instead uses mounted cameras and special video goggles to see the world from their drone’s perspective, also known as first-person racing.</p>

                <p>The racers are all men of mixed ages, wearing mostly jeans, T-shirts, and cargo shorts. More than a few work in the computer industry in one capacity or another. The video goggles let them fly from anywhere nearby, they take a seat in picnic chairs, leaning into the corners as they race as if playing an intense session of racing video game.</p>

                <q><strong>It’s a bit like a video game apart from it’s not virtual</strong></q>
                
                <p>In the words of Bradley Austin, a 23 year old first-time FPV racer who teaches video game design for a living. "In a game you crash, you reload, you crash, you reload. If you crash your drone you’ve got to go pick it up and solder it back together, so you’ve got that adrenaline going that your £600 investment might smash into a tree."</p>

                <h3>Drag Race</h3>
                <p>A race between two or more multicopters over a short distance, usually around 100m, as a test of acceleration and top speed.</p>
                
                <h3>Time Trial</h3>
                <p>A test of a multicopter's speed through a run, in which the finishing time is recorded.</p>
